    <p>We are raised, from our early years, with and to solve problems. Everything we have to do is presented as a problem to solve - to walk, to eat in a certain manner, to read, to learn, subjects at school, how we behave, how not to, what to do in life, how to succeed, how to relate to people, how to belong to society, how to practice religion… the mind is full of problems very early on. The problem gives us occupation. Something to do. <span class="bold italic">Then all our life we move from one problem to another.</span> Even if we solve a problem, we immideately create another - for example - one might solve their problem of having their own house - the next instant they'll create one of having another one for security or of wanting a bigger one or of now dealing with mortgage…</p>
    <p>Now, I don't have any problem with this. But we usually don't even know where half of these problems will come to use, Like Algebraic Expressions. <span class="bold italic">DUDE</span> When are even going to use 2x + 3x + (-1123xyz) +69<span class="italic">(Nice)</span></p>
